# ytdl-accessible

**Download audio and video from the web, on a Mac, without fighting your screen reader.**

It saves the file where you tell it and leaves it alone. It never opens or plays
anything.

Works on about 1,750 sites — YouTube, Bandcamp, SoundCloud, Vimeo, the BBC,
archive.org, Mixcloud — and on plain links to a media file.

You get three things:

- **`ytdl`** — a command that says what it is doing in whole sentences
- **Media Download** — an app in your Applications folder, if you would rather click
- **`ytdescribe`** — audio description for a video (see the end)

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Matthew2244/ytdl-accessible.git
cd ytdl-accessible
./install.sh
```

That checks for [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), installs `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` if you
do not have them, puts the commands somewhere on your PATH, and builds the app. It
never uses `sudo`. If it needs you to do something — like adding a folder to your
PATH — it says so in plain words at the end.

To remove everything later: `./install.sh --uninstall`

Then either open **Media Download** from your Applications folder, or copy a link
and run:

```bash
ytdl
```

`ytdl --setup` walks you through where downloads go and what format you want.

## Why this exists

yt-dlp is excellent. Its **output** is the problem if you listen to your computer
rather than look at it.

The default progress display rewrites a single terminal line many times a second
using a carriage return. A screen reader re-announces on every write, so it spends
the entire download interrupting itself and never finishes a sentence. You get a
stream of noise, and no usable information.

`ytdl` runs yt-dlp with progress suppressed and prints **one line per event** instead:

```
Journey Uptown — Matthew Whitaker
6 minutes 42 seconds. About 8 MB.
Downloading...

Done. Saved to Media Downloads as Journey Uptown.opus (7.9 MB)
```

`--progress` adds a percentage line at most **every 10 seconds** — slow enough that
a screen reader can finish speaking it before the next one arrives.

Everything else here follows from the same idea: errors are sentences rather than
tracebacks, durations are "6 minutes 42 seconds" rather than `402`, and anything
that would need a glance at a progress bar is instead reported when it matters.

## What it needs

macOS and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). The installer handles the rest.

`ytdescribe` additionally wants the `claude` CLI on your PATH to read the video
frames, and an ElevenLabs key in the Keychain as `elevenlabs-api-key` if you want
the description spoken. Both are optional — `ytdl` does not need either.

## Usage

```
ytdl                       URL from the clipboard
ytdl <url>                 your default format, into your default folder
ytdl <url> --info          what you would get, downloads nothing
```

**Settings**

```
ytdl --setup                 walk through every setting, one question at a time
ytdl --settings              show what is set
ytdl --set notify=yes        change one setting directly
```

`--setup` asks seven questions — where downloads go, default format, whether to
ping your phone, whether to announce progress, auto-update, browser cookies, and a
video height cap. Enter keeps whatever is already set, Control-C leaves without
saving. **A flag always beats a saved setting**, so nothing you save locks you in.

The first run mentions `--setup` exactly once, and only *after* a download has
already worked. A setup prompt standing between someone and their first file is the
fastest way to make a tool feel like homework.

**Choosing a format**

```
  --format KIND            best, m4a, opus, mp3, wav, flac or video
  --video --mp3 --wav      shorthand for the same
  --pick                   list the real formats and choose by number
  --list-formats           list them and stop
  --max-height 720         cap video height
  --format-id 251          an exact yt-dlp format id
  --set-default wav        remember a format, so you stop typing the flag
  --settings               show what you have saved
```

**Several at once**

```
ytdl <url> <url> <url>       several links, one after another
  --batch links.txt          a file of links, one per line
  --jobs                     what is downloading now, what just finished
```

They run in sequence rather than in parallel, which keeps sites from
rate-limiting you, and **one failure never abandons the rest** — the run reports
how many made it. `--jobs` works from anywhere, including while a download
started by the app is still going.

**Anything this does not cover**

```
  --yt-dlp="--write-thumbnail"    raw arguments straight to yt-dlp
  --yt-dlp-help                   every yt-dlp option there is
```

yt-dlp has roughly 200 options. Giving each one a wrapper flag would make
`--help` unreadable by ear — which is precisely the problem this tool exists to
solve. So the common ones are curated above and everything else passes straight
through. Full coverage, no bloat. (The equals sign is required: a value starting
with a dash looks like a flag to the argument parser.)

**Part of a video**

```
  --from 1:30              start there (also accepts 90 or 1:02:03)
  --to-time 3:45           stop there
  --chapters               also split into one file per chapter
  --subtitles              also fetch English subtitles as .srt
```

**Playlists**

```
  --playlist               the whole list, into its own numbered folder
  --list-items <url>       number every episode, so you can see what to pick
  --items 1-10             or 3,5,7 — just those
  --no-resume              re-fetch items already downloaded
```

In the app, a playlist link offers a third choice: **Pick the ones I want**,
which shows every episode as a tick list. Ticking beats typing a range of
numbers at something you cannot see, and it reads item by item under VoiceOver.
`--list-items` is the same thing on the command line — numbers are useless until
you can see what they refer to.

**Everything else**

```
  --sites bandcamp         is a site supported? (about 1,750 are)
  --to PATH                a different folder, just this once
  --name "..."             filename, without extension
  --progress               a percentage line every 10 seconds, no faster
  --cookies [BROWSER]      sign-in cookies, for "confirm you're not a bot"
  --notify                 Pushover ping on finish and on failure
  --quiet                  print the final path and nothing else
  --update                 upgrade yt-dlp now, and say what actually changed
  --no-auto-update         never upgrade yt-dlp on its own
```

Downloads default to `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Media Downloads`
(iCloud Drive). `ytdl --set-default --to ~/Music` changes that for good; `--to` changes
it for one run.

**`best` never converts; a named format sometimes must.** `--format best` keeps the
source codec, so a Bandcamp FLAC stays FLAC and an MP3 stays an MP3. Naming a format
(`m4a`, `mp3`, `wav`) guarantees the file type but converts when the source is not
already that codec — a lossy generation for the lossy ones. Measured on a plain MP3:
`best` kept it at 32 KB, `--format m4a` re-encoded it to 67 KB. Bigger *and* lossier.

**Nothing here ever opens a file.** Downloads are written and left alone, so whatever
app owns the format on your Mac is never launched. If double-clicking a download opens
something you don't want, that is macOS file association, not this tool — and
`--set-default` lets you pick a format whose association you're happy with.

## Working on it

```bash
./check.sh
```

Compiles the AppleScript, parses the Python, confirms every command-line option
has help text, and checks two things about the dialogs that are easy to get
wrong and invisible once wrong: that no dialog has the same button set as both
default and cancel (which silently kills Escape), and that every list offers a
Back item. Exits non-zero if anything fails.

It exists because a broken AppleScript once got committed and pushed: the
compile failed, the error scrolled past, and the app was left missing from
Applications. Anything checkable should be checked by something that does not
get tired.

## Design notes

The parts that are less obvious than they look.

**Part-files never touch the destination.** yt-dlp writes `.part` files, per-fragment
chunks, and separate audio and video streams that ffmpeg merges afterwards. Written
straight into a synced folder — iCloud Drive, Dropbox — every one of those syncs to
your other devices and is then deleted. yt-dlp solves this itself with split paths,
so `ytdl` uses `-P temp:` for a local scratch directory and `-P home:` for the real
destination. Only the finished file ever appears there.

**The default never re-encodes.** `-x --audio-format best` keeps the source codec and
only changes the container: AAC lands as `.m4a`, Opus as `.opus`. Preferring `.m4a`
for tidiness would give you the *worse* stream — YouTube's Opus is typically ~106 kbps
against the AAC's ~130 kbps, and Opus wins comfortably at that bitrate. `--mp3` and
`--wav` are conversions, and the help text says so.

**Playlist detection cannot key on `list=`.** That is a YouTube URL parameter, so a
Bandcamp album or a SoundCloud set sailed straight past the guard. Every other site
announces itself in the metadata instead, and YouTube is the one that does *not* —
`--no-playlist` collapses it to a single video before you can see it. So both signals
are checked. Error messages name the actual extractor too; blaming YouTube for a
Bandcamp failure is both wrong and confusing.

**`--info` asks yt-dlp what it would pick** rather than ranking the formats itself.
It passes the same `-f` selector the download will use into the `-J` call and reads
the selection back. An earlier version re-implemented the ranking and confidently
reported the 130 kbps AAC while the download quietly took the 106 kbps Opus.

**Playlists are refused unless asked for.** A URL copied from a queue carries `&list=`
on the end. Honouring that silently would drop a few hundred files on you. The count
comes from `--flat-playlist --playlist-items 0`, which reports `playlist_count`
without fetching the entries.

**A playlist must be listed flat, not extracted.** With `--playlist`, the metadata
call uses `--flat-playlist`. Without it, `-J` extracts every entry in full — for a
channel's uploads that is hundreds of round trips, and it simply times out before
anything downloads. Flat returns the list and its titles in one request and leaves
per-video work to the download itself.

**Partial playlist success is reported as partial success.** `--ignore-errors` keeps
yt-dlp going past a bad item, and it still exits non-zero afterwards. Treating that as
total failure would throw away news of every file that *did* arrive, leaving re-running
as the only way to find out. Each item is announced as it starts, an archive file beside
the downloads records what completed, and re-running the same command resumes rather
than starting over.

**`--sub-langs "en.*"` is a trap.** It looks like "any English track" and actually
matches every auto-*translated* variant YouTube offers — `en-de`, `en-fr`, and dozens
more. That is enough requests to earn an HTTP 429 instead of a subtitle file. The real
English tracks are named explicitly. `-i` goes with it, because subtitles are a bonus
and a bonus must never cost the download: without it, one failed subtitle fetch aborts
the run and you get no media at all.

**An exact format id is taken as it comes.** `--format-id 251` (Opus) once landed as a
fatter, lossier `.m4a`, because a *saved default* of m4a was still being applied on top
of the stream that had been explicitly named. A saved default must never silently
transcode a stream you went to the trouble of asking for; an explicit flag still wins.

**Auto-update is triggered by failure, not by a timer.** YouTube breaks yt-dlp
periodically, and the moment a newer version is worth having is the moment a download
fails. So that is the primary trigger: on a failure, if a newer release exists, `ytdl`
upgrades and retries once — turning "it failed, go update, try again" into one command
that just works.

Two guards make that safe to leave on. It only fires for failures an upgrade could
plausibly fix — a private, removed or members-only video will fail identically on
every version ever released, and spending a minute on `brew` to prove that is worse
than just saying so. And it only retries when the version genuinely moved, so a
Homebrew that has nothing newer costs you one no-op rather than a pointless second
attempt.

The secondary trigger is a once-a-day check **after a successful download**, so the
upgrade has usually already happened before a break can reach you. Neither check ever
runs *before* a download — nothing should stand between you and the file you asked
for. `--no-auto-update` turns both off.

**No age-based staleness check.** An early version warned when yt-dlp was more than
30 days old. But yt-dlp releases irregularly, so this called a perfectly current
install stale — the warning fired on every failure and pointed at `--update`, which
correctly replied "already up to date". Version comparison is against the GitHub
releases API, and **stays silent when it cannot reach it**: "could not check" and
"you are behind" must never look the same.

**The app exports PATH before doing anything.** A GUI-launched macOS app inherits a
minimal `PATH` of `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`, with no Homebrew in it — so yt-dlp
is invisible and every download fails while the identical command works fine in a
terminal. This is the classic way a working script dies as an app.

## The Mac app

`YouTubeDownload.applescript` compiles to an app you can launch from Applications or
Spotlight. Dialogs rather than a Terminal window, because each dialog is readable by
VoiceOver and a scrolling terminal is the thing this project exists to avoid.

It prefills the URL from the clipboard, asks for a format, validates the link
**before** starting anything, then launches the download detached and returns
immediately — a blocking app with no progress readout would be the worst of both
worlds.

## Optional: Pushover

`--notify` sends a [Pushover](https://pushover.net) notification on completion, and on
failure at priority 1 so it beats quiet hours. It shells out to a `pushover` script on
your `PATH` and **silently does nothing if you don't have one**, so this costs you
nothing if you don't use it.

If you do, note that Pushover rejects the *entire* notification for an unknown sound
name — so `notify()` retries without `--sound` rather than losing the message. Upload
custom sounds named `ytdl-done` and `ytdl-fail`, or edit those constants.

## `ytdescribe` — audio description

```
ytdescribe <url>              find or make a description
ytdescribe <url> --spoken     also render it as speech
ytdescribe <url> --mix        also mix that speech under the original audio
```

Three sources, in descending order of how much they are worth trusting.

**1. A descriptive audio track on the video itself.** Rare, but real human
description. Checked first, always, and across every metadata field that has carried
it — the shape differs by site and has changed more than once, and a missed track
means inventing description that a person already wrote.

**2. A separate video that IS the described version.** This is where audio description
actually lives on YouTube. Searching "audio described" turns up whole channels of them,
published as their own videos rather than as alternate tracks — which is worth knowing,
because looking only for alternate tracks finds almost nothing. You are shown the
candidates and pick one; a title match is not treated as proof.

**3. Generated, only when the first two come up empty.** Frames are sampled at *shot
changes* rather than on a fixed clock — a fixed interval either misses a cut or
describes the same shot five times. They are then read **in order and in batches**, so
the description has continuity and can refer back ("the same room") instead of being a
list of disconnected stills.

It is invented description, and **every file it writes says so at the top.** A
confident wrong description is worse than an honest gap.

The spoken mix **ducks the original rather than fitting the gaps.** Real audio
description goes strictly in the pauses, but choosing which line matters more than
which sentence of dialogue is an editorial judgement this cannot make. Ducking is the
honest compromise, and it is named as one.
