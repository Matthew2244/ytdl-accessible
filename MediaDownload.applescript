-- Media Download — a launcher for ~/bin/ytdl.
--
-- Not YouTube-only: yt-dlp handles about 1,750 sites.
--
-- KEYBOARD. Command-Q and Command-W do nothing in an osacompile applet: the
-- bundle has no menu bar for them to bind to, and `display dialog` runs a modal
-- session that blocks menus anyway. Escape is the way out, and it behaves as
-- follows — measured, not assumed:
--
--   one button, set as BOTH default and cancel  ->  Escape does NOTHING
--   one button, set as cancel only              ->  Escape and Space work
--   two buttons, default and cancel different   ->  Escape and Return work
--
-- And separately, measured the same way: `choose from list` ignores Escape and
-- Command-period completely, even when the app is frontmost. Its Cancel button
-- is clickable but no key reaches it. So every list here also carries a plain
-- "Back" item, because a menu you can enter and not leave by keyboard is a
-- trap.
--
-- The first shape is the trap, and it is the obvious thing to write. Every
-- one-button dialog here therefore sets `cancel button` and no default.
--
-- Escape never closes the app. It means back or dismiss everywhere; on the
-- link box it does nothing, because there is nothing behind it. Quit is a
-- button press only, since Escape is easy to hit by accident.
--
-- WORDING. Buttons say what they do, so the body does not have to explain
-- them. Earlier versions listed every button with a description and became a
-- wall of text — costly when you are listening rather than looking. The long
-- explanations live in Help, once, where they can be read on purpose.
--
-- A GUI-launched app gets a minimal PATH (/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin), so
-- Homebrew is invisible to it and yt-dlp would not be found. Hence the
-- explicit PATH on every shell call.
